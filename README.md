# Understanding Transformer Memorization Recall Through Idioms
This repository contains dataset of idioms for probing memorization in pretrained LM. "[Understanding Transformer Memorization Recall Through Idioms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03588)".


## Datasets
IdioMem is a probe dataset of Englidh idioms for analyzing memorization behavior. The dataset is formated as a jsonl file, and can be found  "[here]. (https://github.com/adihaviv/idiomem/blob/main/idiomem.jsonl).
Details of the constraction of IdioMem and methodical approch for probing via IdioMem is described in the paper. 

## Code
Coming soon!
